TwitterLeap
===========
First Leap Integration App uses gestures to browse tweets

*Important*
===========
Set your library path system property when running the app to point to
 the Leap Motion dll or dylib library.
Eg -Djava.library.path=/Path/to/Project/TwitterLeap/leaplib

I've included the 1.0 release of the Mac dylib but if on
Windows / Linux please download the Leap SDK from
http://developer.leapmotion.com and drop in the relevant
32 or 64 bit dll files (or Linux .so equivalent) in this folder.

See https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/Languages/Java/Guides/Sample_Java_Tutorial.html for more info
